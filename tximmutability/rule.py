class ImmutabilityRule(object):
    """
    This class serves to define the rule when an model is immutable.
    To define immutability rule it is obligatory to define field name
    of the model from which depend model immutability. To define relation field use '__' as separator

    Once field value is defined model becomes immutable(you can not update it or delete it).
    To allow update/delete of the object set param allow_update/allow_delete to True

    To allow object mutability for the specific field's values
    define that values in mutable_states param

    To exclude some fields from the rule and make them mutable define field names in 
    mutable_fields param

    Examples:
        - Only invoice note can be changed if invoice is not in draft state.
        ImmutabilityRule('estado', mutable_states=('draft',), mutable_fields=('note',))
        - Asiento can not be deleted (but can be updated) if related invoice is validated
